# Buildable Components
This doc contains information on how to configure buildable components and
actually build them.

Buildable components have 2 key files:

- build
- image

## Build file 
This file is used to build and test code.  This is where build and test tools
would be installed.

## Image file
This file is used to produce the final publishable artifact.  This would be a
leaner and hardened image to use in production.
